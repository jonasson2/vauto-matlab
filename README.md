# vauto â€“ Exact VARMA Likelihood in MATLAB

**vauto** is a MATLAB library for computing the exact likelihood and gradient of VARMA (Vector Autoregressive Moving Average) models, supporting both complete and incomplete data.  
It accompanies **Algorithm 878** and its companion methodology paper, published in *ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS), 35(1), 2008*.

This repository hosts the actively maintained MATLAB version (currently **v1.1.0**).  
Earlier releases (**v1.0.0**, **v1.0.1**) are available under **GitHub Releases**.
